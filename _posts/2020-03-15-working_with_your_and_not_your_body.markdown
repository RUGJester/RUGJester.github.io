Simple, but right. My father got out of the military after twelve years in the infantry, and followed that by installing cable and various other physical jobs. After putting himself through a certificate program, he became a network engineer.

Dad encouraged and pushed me to learn programming in high school and to seek that as my career, but to no avail because I knew better. I've done a variety of things, most notably as a certified nursing assistant, waste water operator and predominantly as a plumber. I realized a few years ago that wear and tear wasn't just for other people, and despite making good money, I wasn't making enough to compensate for the physical toll on my body. 

I needed to move to into a career that allowed me to use my mind and improve my upward mobility. My father, and half a dozen friends pushed me to make the change and Justin in particular suggested Flatiron. I've cut my teeth enough, and now it's time to use my brain to make my money and not my arm.
